why is this stuff missing?

license doesnt allow me to redistribute the jwplayer...

if you still want to use it, you can download
your version of jwplayer from jwplayer.com

extract the zip directly into this directory.

what you will need are 3 files from the jwplayer zip:

jwplayer.flash.swf
jwplayer.html5.js
jwplayer.js

after you have unzipped them, you can change the
config.php file and let it point to "jwplayer"
instead of projekktor, and youre done.

enjoy!
