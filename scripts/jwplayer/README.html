<h2>Quick Start</h2>

<p>Copy the <strong>jwplayer</strong> folder that contains this README to the www root of your website. Next, include the <em>jwplayer.js</em> script in the &lt;head&gt; of your HTML page. If you have a JW Player Key, add it in a second line right below the first one:</p>

<pre>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="/jwplayer/jwplayer.js" &gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;jwplayer.key="ABCDEFGHIJKLMOPQ";&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>This key will automatically track video analytics to your JW Player account. If you don't have an account yet, check your inbox for your download confirmation e-mail or <a href="http://www.longtailvideo.com/jw-player/signup/">click here to sign up</a> and get your key.</p>

<p>Now scroll down to the &lt;body&gt; of your HTML page and insert the JW Player embed code at the place you want your video to appear:</p>

<pre>
&lt;div id="myElement"&gt;Loading the player...&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    jwplayer("myElement").setup({
        file: "/uploads/example.mp4",
        image: "/uploads/example.jpg",
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
