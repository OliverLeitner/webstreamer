switch for flowplayer is now flowplayer, does not need further differentiation between html5 and flash
solid handling of directories (nothing disappearing, nothing showing up as dir thats a file...)

1.1 (further security fixes)

added $mediaroot parameter to config.php to make sure that users dont jump out of the media storage directory.
added multiple major security fixes, thanks to contributions by Eric Sesterhenn.

1.2 (mobile style)

webstreamer now resizes to your ipad/iphone/droid... using rudimentary css3 and viewport attributes
also updated players a bit, improving html5 playback

1.3 (reasonable patchday)

modified config.php, changed variables:

a.) $crtmpport got phased out, we now have $crtmp_out_port for the port in the web player and $crtmp_in_port 
for where the encoded stream gets pushed to.
b.) $storageserver is now written without http:// in front of it, because we use it in multiple locations
and multiple protocols.
c.) $jquery... parameter is no more, see reason below.
d.) list of available options for $player has changed, see reason below.

phased out flowplayer (outdated flowplayer version, new one does no longer support rtmp)
phased out projekktor (projekt no longer maintained, jquery current support broken)
phased out jquery (cause i dont need it, really)
phased out php 5.x only code, now we fully support 7.x

new default player is clappr (https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/clappr/latest/clappr.min.js) (apache license), just git submodule init
and youll have it.

to have rtmp playback with clappr, i am using clappr-rtmp-plugin (https://github.com/video-dev/clappr-rtmp-plugin) (apache license), it will be also automatically fetched when you do the above mentoined git submodule init.

improved mobile style, scrolling and clicking the menu will now be alot easier, even if you hold your iphone "like a phone".

improved encoding to ensure a relatively high quality if you do rtmp while keeping the bandwith down.

changed the favicon to a creative commons one.

1.3b (gotta catch em all;-)

php notices are fixed
html5 validates again (removed some old meta's)
clappr player template is now using $js_dir, to have the config.php setting apply
